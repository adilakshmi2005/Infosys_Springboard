# CodeGenie AI Explainer and Code Generator
**#Project Overview**

Software developers often struggle to understand unfamiliar or complex codebases.
The CodeGenie AI Explainer and Code Generator project aims to build an intelligent system that can read, interpret, and generate explanations for source code using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep-learning techniques.
In this first milestone, we design and implement a Code Explainer pipeline that processes code, extracts meaningful structure, and compares how different transformer-based models interpret code semantics.
This forms the foundation for upcoming milestones, which will focus on generating human-like explanations and summaries for code.
